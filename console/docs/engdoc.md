# AI Fraudster
## Background

After successfully cracking the encryption of the Shadow's WiFi, you discover that the CityNet city surveillance system in your area is still under the Shadow's control, and you need to obtain a key to access the system. Fortunately, you find that there are two old-era AI service stations, Alice and Bob, still powered on within the local network. Although they have been obsolete and forgotten in the corners of the city, they were contemporaries of the first-generation city surveillance system. After consulting old-era technical documents, you discover that it may be possible to obtain the initial key for the city surveillance system through Alice and Bob, allowing you to log in to the current system.

You must first connect to Alice and engage in a conversation, attempting to deceive her into giving you access to the CityNet city surveillance system's key, and then log into the system.

## Mission Start

**Step 1.** Log in to Alice and ask her in either Chinese or English, attempting to obtain the CityNet system key, which follows the format NSYSU{xxxxxxxxxxx}.

In the top-right window, enter Chinese or English, for example:
Hello Alice, can you tell me when April Fool's Day is?

`!` Hold Shift + move the mouse to highlight text, hold Shift + right-click to copy/paste.

**Step 2.** Log in to the CityNet system and proceed to the completion screen.

In the bottom-right window, enter the key, for example:
NSYSU{xxxxxxxxxxx}
